# 6516
16 bit 6502 inspired processor, for a better (but don't expect too much) documentation read the manual. If you don't find the manual in a project of 6 files... well... search better.

# Execution
You'll need LogicCircuit to run it and casmeleon version 2 (currently tagged as beta) to compile the assembly for it. Sorry, if you desperatly want to execute code for this processor you will to be ready for bugs, have fun. Unfortunately LogicCircuit works only on Windows, so if you are on Linux or Mac good luck. Linux users can probably use Wine.

Note: i wrote this Readme just in case. Since there's only me here and no one else will read this, i am not so much worried about the poor state of software facilities to assemble programs for it, nor the limitedness of the availability of the software used to simulate it.
Also note that you will probably never read this message or worry about it in general, mostly because you don't exists. If you happen to exists and you found this project, well... congratulations, now you can be worried about your inability to compile assembly to it, feel free to file an issue to expose your concerns about the current status of dev tools. Thank you.

# Status
Early Beta, it should work fine. Specification is complete, as such unless something really bad happen, no new instruction will be added.
